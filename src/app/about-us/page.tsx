        <p className="bg-white text-center text-2xl mt-20">"Hello! This is <span> Rabia Rizwan!" </span> I have completed courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining a solid foundation in web development. With HTML, I can structure content effectively, and with CSS, I create visually appealing designs that enhance user experience. Learning JavaScript has opened up new possibilities for adding interactivity to my projects. Iâ€™m excited to apply these skills in future projects, potentially exploring frameworks like React or Vue.js to build dynamic applications. </p>
