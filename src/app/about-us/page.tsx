        I have completed courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining a solid foundation in web development.
         With HTML, I can structure content effectively, and with CSS, 
         I create visually appealing designs that enhance user experience.
          Learning JavaScript has opened up new possibilities for adding interactivity to my projects.
           Iâ€™m excited to apply these skills in future projects, 
        potentially exploring frameworks like React or Vue.js to build dynamic applications.
